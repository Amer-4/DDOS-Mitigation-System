# DDOS-Mitigation-System
This project demonstrates a practical approach to mitigating Layer 7 (HTTP Flood) DDoS attacks using a cloud-native infrastructure on AWS. It involves deploying multiple EC2 instances behind a load balancer, implementing access control and rate limiting, and dynamically analyzing and blocking malicious traffic through custom Python scripts.
